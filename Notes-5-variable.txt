Class
Object -- object is an entity which will have its own states and behaviour 
----
There are two categories of variable
1. Local
2. Global

Local Variables are those variables which are declared or 
created inside a method or a block.

Local variable scope is only inside the method or 
block in which it is developed or created.

we cannot categories local variable into static or non static.

Global variable are those variables which are declared outside of any method
or  a block but within the class.

Global variable can be accessed from all parts of the class.

Global Variable can be categorized into static or non static.

Static variable are also called as Class Variables.
Non - static variables are also called as instance variable.

====================-------================
Method arguments will always be local variable

Local variable is created on stack when the method/block is loaded.

Once method execution is over, local variable is erased along with 
method/stack control return to caller/main

============----------
Before using any variable, it should have some value -- initialization

If we do not initialize global variable (static or non static), then
global variable will be storing default values depending on data type

for local variable there will not be any default values if not initialized.

========final variable -- constant ===
what is final ?
final is keyword

If you want declare constant a constant variable in java
then we will declare with keyword final

final variable value cannot be changed or overridden

both local and global variable can be final.

 global final variable should be initialized at the time of declaration
 local final variable can be declared and intialized  later (only once)
