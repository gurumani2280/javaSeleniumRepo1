Selenium project set up
------------=======------------

set  JAVA_HOME -- C:\DevSoft\JDK1.8
echo %JAVA_HOME%

1. download maven --- set the path and maven home

https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

download and unzip the bin file -- 


set M2_HOME  -  C:\software\apache-maven-3.5.0
echo %M2_HOME%

set/ update path till to bin folder -- C:\software\apache-maven-3.5.0\bin
mvn -version



2. create simple maven project

3. add the dependency for selenium in pom.xml

4. inside main method write 
	WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()
	run the code, observe the error/exception

5. download chromeDriver exe for chrome, gecko  for firefox
https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/#client-drivers  --- > expand browsers -- > click Documentation
	set the path for the exe
	System.setProperty("webdriver.gecko.driver", driverPath);

	then run the code

what is Automation?
	Converting manual test cases into automation script.

why automation? when we go for automation?
	To overcome the drawbacks of manual testing, We go for automation. Manual testing requires
		i) More man power -- more test cases
		ii) More time --- more time to regression
		iii) Human may tend to do mistakes as manual is monotonus.


what is selenium?
	Selenium automates browsers. That's it! 
	Selenium is a set of tools and libraries which is used to automate browsers.

What is webdriver?
	WebDriver is an interface in which all the methods are invoked by the browser classes.

selenium architecture and protocols?
(How selenium works? and Which protocol is used by Selenium to interact/communicate with the browser?)
	By calling the native methods of the browser.
	JSON Wire Protocol (Java Script Object Notation)

	Selenium supports multiple coding languages. 
	Each language has its own binding which communicates with WebDriver API.
	The WebDriver API performs the action on the browser by using browser specific drivers (Uses JSON Wire Protocol)


selenium hierarchy?
	SearchContext is super most interfaces which are extended by WebDriver interface.
	Abstract methods of these two interfaces is implemented in Remote WebDriver class
	and overridden in respective browser classes such as FirefoxDriver, ChromeDriver, InternetExplorerDriver, SafariDriver etc.


language binding?

launching browser
basic browser handling
handling browser navigation

selenium architecture --   search in google and see the diagram


There are four basic components of WebDriver Architecture:

	1. Selenium Language Bindings
	Selenium developers have built language bindings/Selenium Client Libraries in order to support multiple languages
https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/#client-drivers

	2. JSON Wire Protocol
	JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard for exchanging data on web.

	3. Browser Drivers
	Selenium uses drivers, specific to each browser in order to establish a secure connection with the browser without revealing the internal logic of browser's functionality.

	4. Real Browsers

	Browsers supported by Selenium WebDriver:
