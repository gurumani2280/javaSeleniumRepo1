Exception 

exceptions are nothing but run time error.
some statements will be syntactically correct but might behave abnormally at run time, resulting in run time error
if a program results in run time error , then it will be teminated abruptly
so addressing run time error through try catch block , so that program continues its execution , is called as exception handling
we can handle run time error using try catch block
risky statement which might behave abnormally at run time , should be kept inside try block and a appropriate catch block to addres the exception
if exception is handled using  try catch then program will not be terminated abruptly , program will continue its execution

one try block can have any number of catch block but only appropriate catch block will execute
we should develop catch block from most specific exception class to most generic exception class 
and we should duplicate exception
Throwable catch block can handle any type of exception ,
because Throwable is the supermost class for all exception related classes
 


There are two type of exception :-
1. checked
2. unchecked

1. Unchecked -- unchecked will not be detected at complie time. 
	Here compiler cannot identify that certain statement might generate exception or behave abnormally at run time
	this kind of exception is known as unchecked exception
	All Error related classes and RunTimeException Related classed fall under unchecked exception

2. Checked -- checked exception will be detected at compile time.
	Here compiler can identify that certain statement might generate exception or behave abnormally at execution time
	there are two ways to handle them 
	1. try catch
	2. using throws keyword in method signature
	
	throws is keyword which is used to re-throw the already generated exception
	or it delegates the exception to other method


finally is a block which will used in exception handling
finally block will be used to executed certain statements without fail , irrespective of exception occured or not
e.g. sql connection , file system 
All the connection established b/w database , file system of computer can be closed inside finally block 
so that resources will be used efficiently



garbage collection :- 

	the process of removing the unreachable or abandoned object from the heap memory is called as garbage collection.

	abandoned object means those object which will not have any reference 

	Garbage collector is a background thread or daemon thread (lowest priority thread)
	which will clear the abandoned objects from the heap memory 
	by using the finalize() method of the abandoned object

Assignment question ? what is difference between final , finally and finalize?


creating user defined exception -- by inheriting any of the exception class
