casting :: -- casting means conversion

type casting :: conveting data /object from one  type to another.

casting is of two types primitive casting and object casting
------========---------------
1.primitive casting :-
	converting from one primitive data to another data type.
	It is again of two type

	1. widening (auto/implicit widening) or (explicit widening)
	converting the primitive data from lower type to anyone of the higher type.

	auto/implicit widening --- compiler performing widening operation automatically at compile time
	  double d = 10;

	explicit widening -- programmer performing widening operation while developing code.
	  double d = (double)10;

	 ---  ----  ---> ---- >  --- >widening---  ----  ---> ---- >  --- >

	byte --> short --> int --> long --> float --> double 

	---  <----  ---< ---- <  --- < narrowing ---  <----  ---< ---- <  --- 

	2. narrowing (explicit narrowing )

	converting the primitive data from higher type to anyone of the lower type.

	Narrowing is not automatic.
	programmer should perform narrowing while developing code.
	int a  = 0.5; // CTE
	int a  = (int)0.5;
	 
2. Object casting
	converting object of one class type to another type.
	to perform object casting inheritance is Mandatory.

	converting object from subclass type to super class type  or super class to subclass type
	
	Object casting is of two types

	1. Upcasting (auto/implicit) or (explicit)
		1. sub class feature will be hidden -- cannot acces them
		2. only can access super class member , 
		3. In case of upcasting we can access overridden methods but will get latest implementation
	
explain   WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();  /// auto or implicit upcasting
	WebDriver is super interface
	driver is reference variable
	new is an operator
	ChromeDriver is sub class to webdriver interface

	once we have achieved upcasting we can achieve polymorphism

	2. DownCasting (explicit only -- no automatic / implicitly)
		1. direct downcasting not allowed --- gives run time error -- ClassCastException
		2. can only downcast -- the upcasted object -- 
		   so the hidden feature of subclass(due to upcasting) can be accessed
